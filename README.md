# AngularCarPreferencesChart
This is a repo that I made to get one of my D3 projects up onto Heroku. I made it using both Angular as the frontend to practice getting accustomed with using Angular as a frontend framework. I plan on using Angular more as a frontend framework for future web applications that I make as fun projects. Here is what I used in addition to Angular:
- D3 as a data visualization library for showing the Car preferences data as a bar graph
- Webpack to compile the Angular code into a JavaScript file.
